title: Ontology Mapping | OSHWA â†’ OKHv2
---

# Notes

The Open Source Hardware Association created the [definition of Open Source Hardware](https://www.oshwa.org/definition) and launched [the first certification programme for OSH](https://certification.oshwa.org/).

Certified projects are listed here: <https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html>

Since OSHWA released an [API](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/) making the metadata of certified projects available for the general public (plus you can apply for certification directly via this API).

Source for the mapping: token from [here](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/) (see [issue 9](https://github.com/OPEN-NEXT/LOSH/issues/9#issuecomment-733939646) for details)
