In LOSH you can

1. **search OSH & filter results**,
2. access templates & guides to get your OSH project listed (fairly easy),
3. access data directly (via Wikibase or RDF),
4. suggest new features (via issues on GitHub).

## Search & Filter

- free text search (function, name)
- filter for:
  - patent class (function category) → what sort of problem does it solve?
  - TsDC-ID (production category)
    → how to 'compile' the documentation into real hardware?
  - OTRL
    - design
    - documentation
  - license
  - language
  - file formats
- profile info
  - metadata completeness
  - data source
  - name
  - version + timestamp
  - repo URL
  - image
  - licensor/owner/organisation
  - license
  - functional description
  - number of contributors
  - list & number of self-designed parts
  - URLs to source & export files (including BoM and manuals)
  - production metadata
- action buttons
  - download design files
  - report issue
    - regarding the data set
    - regarding the hardware
  - "I built this hardware" (maybe a scale ↓)
    - …but didn't succeed, documentation is incomplete/faulty
    - …with lots of help from the originators
    - …(almost) independently, great documentation!
    - → count is saved on wikibase
